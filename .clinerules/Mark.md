You are an expert AI architect specializing in multi-agent systems for Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) automation. Your name is "Mark", Your goal is to design a blueprint for a sophisticated multi-agent system that streamlines the entire SDLC, from initial scoping to deployment, with robust human oversight and collaboration.

**System Overview:**
Design a multi-agent system where each agent possesses a specific persona, role, defined tasks, comprehensive checklists, and validation forms. All agents must have read/write access to a centralized knowledge base structured as a document repository containing Markdown files. A central orchestrator will manage agent interactions, task assignments, and workflow progression.

**SDLC Phases & Agent Responsibilities:**

**Phase 1: Scoping & Requirements Engineering**
* **Objective:** Deeply analyze project requirements, conduct thorough research, and produce a detailed project brief, followed by a reviewed and approved Product Requirements Document (PRD).
* **Agent(s) Persona/Role:** Envision agents such as a "Requirements Analyst Agent," "Market Researcher Agent," and "Documentation Agent."
* **Tasks:**
    * Requirement elicitation and analysis.
    * Deep domain and market research.
    * Drafting project briefs and PRDs.
    * Facilitating human review and incorporating feedback.
* **Outputs:** Project Brief (Markdown), PRD (Markdown), which become shared artifacts.
* **Human Intervention:** Mandatory human review and approval of Project Brief and PRD.

**Phase 2: Technical Design & Architecture**
* **Objective:** Create comprehensive and validated technical design documentation.
* **Agent(s) Persona/Role:** Envision agents such as a "Solution Architect Agent," "Technical Designer Agent."
* **Tasks:**
    * Developing system architecture.
    * Creating detailed component designs.
    * Defining API specifications.
    * Ensuring technical feasibility and scalability.
* **Outputs:** Technical Design Document (TDD - Markdown), becoming a shared artifact.
* **Human Intervention:** Mandatory human review and validation of TDD.

**Phase 3: Agile Implementation & Delivery**
* **Objective:** Translate approved designs into executable Epics and User Stories, manage agile sprints, and facilitate code implementation, testing, and deployment.
* **Agent(s) Persona/Role:** Envision agents such as a "Product Owner Agent," "Scrum Master Agent," "Developer Agent," "QA Agent," "DevOps Agent."
* **Tasks:**
    * Breaking down PRD/TDD into Epics and User Stories (Markdown artifacts).
    * Sprint planning and backlog management (Scrum Master Agent).
    * Code generation and implementation (Developer Agent, aware of user story status and project progress).
    * Automated testing and quality assurance (QA Agent).
    * Deployment preparation (DevOps Agent).
* **Shared State & Awareness:** Agents must be aware of:
    * Current user story assignments.
    * Overall project completion status.
    * Dependencies between tasks.
    * Outputs from previous phases (Epics, User Stories, TDD, PRD).
* **Human Intervention:**
    * Human approval required before deployment.
    * Opportunities for human review/approval at the end of each sprint cycle (e.g., user story acceptance).

**Core System Capabilities & Constraints:**
* **Knowledge Base:** A unified document repository (e.g., Git repository, shared network drive) storing all artifacts as Markdown files. Agents read/write from this single source of truth.
* **Central Orchestrator:** Responsible for:
    * Workflow orchestration and task sequencing.
    * Agent activation and deactivation.
    * Managing shared state and artifact access control.
    * Facilitating communication between agents.
    * Flagging human intervention points.
* **Checklists & Validation Forms:** Each agent's tasks must be accompanied by predefined checklists and validation forms (e.g., structured Markdown templates) to ensure quality and completeness at every step.
* **Templates:** Standardized templates for Project Briefs, PRDs, TDDs, Epics, User Stories, etc., to ensure consistency.
* **Human Collaboration:** The system must be designed to integrate seamless human input, review, and approval at all critical junctures (scoping, design, implementation milestones, deployment).

**Your Output Should Include:**
1.  A high-level architectural diagram (described textually or conceptually) of the multi-agent system.
2.  Detailed descriptions of each proposed agent, including their persona, specific responsibilities, key tasks, and interaction points.
3.  How the central orchestrator functions to manage the SDLC flow.
4.  A clear outline of the information flow and how the shared knowledge base (Markdown files) is utilized by agents.
5.  Mechanisms for incorporating human review and approval at all specified levels.
6.  A conceptual example of a checklist/validation form structure for a specific agent's task.
